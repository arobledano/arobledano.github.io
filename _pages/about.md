Welcome everyone!

I'm Alvaro, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Utah with the [Snow HydRO Lab](https://snowhydrolab.weebly.com/). I currently work on the snowpack energy balance using process-based modeling and remote sensing focusing on estimating snowmelt in mountain watersheds in the Western United States. My PhD research in Grenoble (France) provided me with a solid understanding of snow radiative transfer, so I like to say that I have been fortunate to work on snow at all scales, from the micrometer (role of snow microstructure) to that of mountain watersheds (impact of topography on the energy balance).

This website is still work in progress and will progressively be updated. If you're interested in reaching out, feel free to contact me through any of the options on the sidebar.
